## Need for Madness

**Need for Madness** is a very mad car racing/crashing 3D game where you perform stunts to power your car and win by either racing (finishing in first place) or wasting the other cars!
**Think you can handle the madness?** The game will take you into another dimension(s) where cars can jump, leap high in the air and do awesome stuff!

## UNFM2JG

Hello there m80. So you want to hack, and have found my filez. Well, there's no place to start but at the beginning.

NFM2 is programmed with JAVA! If you have no idea what that is, or are scratching your head at what programming is, you definitely need to look over
these pages linked below. Even if you have basic knowledge from some project or class you took once, 
reading through these will help you avoid ERRORS!!!

http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_variable_types.htm
http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_basic_operators.htm
http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_methods.htm

That is the BARE MINIMUM. Feel free to browse around that site a bit more. You wont encounter much more than the above in NFMs files, but it doesn't hurt
to know.

Now that you got that, it's time to get into what makes my files special!!! ♥♥♥

These files are FIXED and READY TO HACK!!! They already contain a project file for BlueJ, double-click and you can begin hacking immediately!

The following is what has been done:
- Most NFMM graphics (except for sparks and new dust)
- NFMM Car Maker codes work correctly
- Floating set() and chk() hack
- Helpful methods: e.g. colorinvert(), paintcs(), imagefilter() 
- Bug fixing! (e.g. DragShot's fixed sortcars(), Readded savecookie() and readcookie(), improved drag[] alternative)

This is what will come:

- 100% NFMM graphics
- More bug fixes
- Add in as many enhancements as I can to make hacking easier and fun!
